# Introducing RingCentral Embeddable 2.0

RingCentral Embeddable 2.0, marks the next generation of this popular RingCentral product, allowing developers to easily embed a RingCentral phone, SMS client, and more into any webpage or web application. 

!!! info "RingCentral Embeddable 2.0 is 100% backwards compatible"
    The 2.x version of RingCentral Embeddable is completely backwards compatible with all previous versions of Embeddable 1.x. This means that developers can quickly and easily upgrade to the latest version with minimal risk of breaking your existing implementation. PubNub subscription which is deprecated in 1.x is removed in 2.x.

## What's new in 2.0

**Updated design**

RingCentral Embeddable 2.0 front-end has been completely refactored to better conform with RingCentral's user interface guidelines and best practices. Users familiar with the RingCentral app will feel right at home using the new version of Embeddable. User interface highlights include:

* **New navigation bar**: A redesigned navigation bar for improved accessibility and navigation efficiency.
* **New phone dialer**: The dialer, calls, voicemail and recordings tabs are merged into the phone tab.
* **New call history**: New call history UI provides a more extensible design so developers can add more options for taking action on past calls.
* **New Text inbox**: Experience a refreshed SMS inbox with a modernized user interface, making message management more efficient. Faxes are split into independent tab.
* **New meetings home**: The meetings interface has been updated for a modernized user interface.

**Direct access to call recordings**

In this new version, a new recordings page has been added, allowing users to conveniently manage and play their recorded calls directly within Embeddable. 

To enable this feature, you must have `ReadCallRecording` app scope added in your RingCentral app settings.

**SMS templates support**

Author responses to common SMS inquiries and share those responses across all employees in your company using RingEX's SMS template feature. This feature require some [special setup](./config/sms-template.md) to fully enable. 

**Enhanced voicemail player** 

The new voicemail player in RingCentral Embeddable 2.x comes with seek support, providing users with more control over their voicemail playback.

**Noise reduction**

Enjoy improved audio quality with noise reduction enabled by default, ensuring a clearer communication experience. This feature is available, but disabled by default in Embeddable 1.x.

**Audio settings**

RingCentral Embeddable 2.x introduces a new audio settings page, allowing users to easily configure their audio input and output devices. It allows users to configure speaker volume and ringtone device.

### Developer features

Over the course of the Embeddable 2.0, we will be working to make the UI more extensible by developers, without developers having to know or code HTML and CSS to conform to the [RingCentral UI standard](https://ringcentral.github.io/juno/).

**Customized settings**

RingCentral Embeddable 2.x introduces a new [customized settings API](./integration/custom-settings.md), offering developers more flexibility to tailor Embeddable's settings to the specific needs of the application it powers. Consider for example a circumstance in which Embeddable is being used within a third-party app, and settings specific to that app need to be made available to end users. This feature allows developers to inject the setting/preference into the "Settings" page using a simple JSON data structure. 

**Customized pages and tabs**

RingCentral Embeddable 2.x allows developers to register [custom tabs](./integration/custom-tab.md) and [custom pages](./integration/custom-page.md) into the widget using a simple JSON schema. This allows developers to extend the user interface of Embeddable in countless ways. Generate fully customized forms to prompt users for input, or create [custom listing screens](./integration/custom-tab.md#show-list-in-customized-tab) to allow users to scroll and search data sources. 

## Try it

If you are using latest build, you will be upgraded to 2.x version automatically. If you want to use fixed version uri, you can upgrade manually:

    Add following code to any website's header to embed a RingCentral phone into that page. 

    ```js

        rcs.src = "https://apps.ringcentral.com/integration/ringcentral-embeddable/2.2.0/adapter.js?clientId=YOUR_RINGCENTRAL_CLIENT_ID";
        var rcs0 = document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];
        rcs0.parentNode.insertBefore(rcs, rcs0);
      })();
    </script>
    ```
