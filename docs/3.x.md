    <script>
      (function() {
        var rcs = document.createElement("script");
        rcs.src = "https://apps.ringcentral.com/integration/ringcentral-embeddable/3.x/adapter.js?clientId=YOUR_RINGCENTRAL_CLIENT_ID&enableSideWidget=1"; // (1)!
        var rcs0 = document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];
        rcs0.parentNode.insertBefore(rcs, rcs0);
      })();
    </script>
    ```

    1. Replace `YOUR_RINGCENTRAL_CLIENT_ID` with your actual RingCentral application client ID

    ```html
    <iframe 
      width="300"
